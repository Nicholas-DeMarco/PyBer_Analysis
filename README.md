Overview of PyBer Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to find the differences in amount of rides people take in urban, suburban, and rural areas. We also find out the seemingly major price differences in how much a ride will cost you and how many drivers there are in each area. The chart created below gives you an easy to read lay out of our final results.
