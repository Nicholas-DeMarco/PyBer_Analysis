# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of PyBer Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to find the differences in amount of rides people take in urban, suburban, and rural areas. We also find out the seemingly major price differences in how much a ride will cost you and how many drivers there are in each area. The chart created below gives you an easy to read lay out of our final results.

Breakdown of Analysis

After breaking down our resources and creating a final summary chart, we are able to come to some conclusions. First, I will provide an image of our summary results, along with some of the code that was used to create our summary chart. Next, we can review the chart and draw out some of our conclusions.

Looking at our summary dataframe provided above. There are quite a few conclusions that we can look at. The amount of total rides that urban areas receive is overwhemingly high compared to that of our rural and suburban areas. While urban area rides totaled to 1,625, suburban areas received only 625, and rural areas received an extremely low amount of rides at only 125. This could be a results of many reasons. One reason that I am seeing that stands out is the amount of drivers in urban areas at 2,405, which I believe is a correlation as to why the average fare for a ride in urban areas is the lowest at $24.53. When we look at our rural areas with the least amount of drivers at 78, the average fare for those rides comes in much higher at $34.62. The last thing I would look at is the total fares brought in by each area. The total fares of urban areas came out to a very high amount of $39,854.38. Next, the total fares of suburban areas came out in the middle at $19,356.33. And lastly, as you can imagine by looking at all of our other results, the total fares of rural areas was the lowest at $4,327.93.

Conclusion of Analysis

To conclude our analysis, let's lay out a few business recommendations for the CEO that may be able to help him/her navigate the areas they are making the least profit in better. One recommendation I have is that it may be beneficial to see what options you have on creating a cheaper and more attainable ride in urban areas. You could possibly offer some incentives for drivers to take more rides from customers in rural areas. If the incentive creates more drivers wanting to drive in rural areas, then this could cause the average fare to lower over time, in turn creating a larger customer base in urban areas. And in the end we know what that means, profits go up! Another recommendation that I have, in order to reduce disparity between areas, instead of focusing on just the first third of the year, the study may gain from having extra data points that span the entire year and provide insights into yearly trends.
